# About

The purpose of this project is to have a simple, standalone implementation in C of the [Bittorrent specification](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html), as laid out [here.](https://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrentSpecification)

Whether it meets this purpose is ultimately up to you to decide. I'm in this to learn.
